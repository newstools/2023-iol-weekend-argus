Pretoria – Police Minister Bheki Cele has provided an update on the AKA murder investigation, saying police have collected several cellphones to get data that will assist in solving the murder of the award-winning rapper. Kiernan “AKA” Forbes, 35, was shot dead on Florida Road, Durban, on February 10. Cele revealed this on Tuesday during a media briefing about crime and gangsterism in Westbury, Johannesburg. He said he is constantly updated on the AKA matter and the last update was on Monday at 10pm.  “It’s a matter that we can’t let rest, unfortunately we cant give you blow by blow updates of what is happening, but the progress is absolutely there.... “We have collected a lot of cellphones that we are working on, download everything and try to patch things together; that’s the last I received on this matter. “We acknowledge that it is not with the speed that the community and the nation would’ve loved to see but watch the space, we are digging deep in this case,” Cele told journalists. #YNews: Police Minister, Bheki Cele says several cellphones linked to the murder of rapper Kieran “AKA” Forbes have been retrieved.
