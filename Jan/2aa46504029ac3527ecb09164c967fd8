Cape Town -- A “technical challenge” crippled the Western Cape Legislature’s email sever, leaving members of the house without access to incoming mails.  They’re also unable to send emails, Weekend Argus understand – a problem that has persisted since January 10.  The legislature’s secretary, Romeo Adams, was quick to note that the matter wasn’t linked to any attacks to their servers.  “While emails to WCPP (Western Cape Provincial Parliament) recipients are being received by our Mimecast email facility, there is a technical challenge affecting the Mimecast and Microsoft interface and WCPP service providers are attending to it.” Opposition party members are seeing red, calling for the legislature’s IT department to rectify the problems as soon as possible. “This is totally unacceptable. It's a complete hindrance to service delivery and our oversight responsibility,” said the ANC’s Khalid Sayed.  “As we speak, many parents who are in dire need to get their learners placed in schools have been sending us emails to get assistance and those emails are bouncing back. We expected by now that the IT unit would be on top of this and we asked the Speaker to get the issue resolved immediately,” Sayed said.  Last November, the City of Cape Town  had to scramble to upgrade its cybersecurity after a “heightened number of cyber attacks”. The attacks, which Weekend Argus first reported on, caused the IT department to temporarily bar 231 councillors from accessing their work emails on their mobile phones. City spokesperson Luthando Tyhalibongo at the time said the City was forced to take action after the security breaches. “Over the past few weeks, our Information Services and Technology Cybersecurity (IS&T) staff noted a heightened number of cyber attacks. We have, therefore, temporarily disabled access to email via unauthorised personal devices,” said Tyhalibongo. Weekend Argus.
