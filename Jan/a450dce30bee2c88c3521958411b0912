"When purchasing toys for your children, ensure that there are various types of balls representing different sports so that they are exposed to different sport codes. Parents can’t really choose which sport their child will play. “However, what you can do is encourage them to take part in sport and continue to support them in the sporting code they have chosen," said Kahla.
