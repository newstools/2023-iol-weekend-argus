Very soon the matric results will be released. For the class of 2022, the matric year was more complicated as learners encountered unexpected hurdles as a result of the pandemic and its effects since Grade 10. Due to the uniqueness of the Covid-19 pandemic hurdles, learners had to navigate these unmapped waters with no “GPS navigation apps” to follow. Hence, both learners and teachers had to “build the plane as they were flying”. Teachers had to take risks, come up with innovative ideas to complete the curriculum and to keep students motivated in order to prepare the class of 2022 for the matric examination. Most definitely, the class of 2022 endured high measures of stress, loneliness and uncertainties. Some of the disappointments and challenges of the past three years may still remain with these learners if not managed professionally. Failing a subject can make a learner feel very uncomfortable and unhappy. Therefore, parents, family members and the community should not judge learners by their non-achievements. Reassure under-performing learners that their unfavourable examination results are not the end of the road. Learners must consult with their respective teachers, subject advisers and professional counsellors or therapists for the different options available to move forward. My warmest congratulations to both teachers and the matric Class of 2022. * Mohamed Saeed, Pietermaritzburg.  ** The views expressed here are not necessarily those of Independent Media.
