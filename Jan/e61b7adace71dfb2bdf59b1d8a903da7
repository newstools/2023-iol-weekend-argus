ALL roads lead to Oudtshoorn this April for the Klein Karoo National Arts Festival (KKNK).  This year’s festival runs April 1-9, to showcase the arts in the Klein Karoo.  Among the performers this year is actress Lizz Meiring, who said she was excited about what was on offer. “Oudtshoorn and all its people feel like my second home. This festival not only ensures that life is breathed into the arts, but life is also breathed into the economy of Oudtshoorn,” she said. “We're going to have an absolutely amazing time. This is an essential injection for the people from Oudtshoorn. One they desperately need. An experience one does not easily get anywhere else. This is how one can describe the KKNK.” The festival also presents honorary awards to artists who have made a contribution to the industry. This year’s recipients includes actor Dawid Minnaar, musician Early B, Refentse Morake and Liza Grobler. Radio presenter Magdaleen Krüger will be presented with a lifetime contribution award. Festival-goers can look forward to more than 30 debut works, as well as an array of productions seen at other festivals and theatres over the past year.  Hugo Theart, CEO and artistic director of the KKNK, said a jam-packed festival programme awaited attendees “The popular open air evening concerts return, as do site-specific plays. The multidisciplinary programme will entertain festival-goers in all genres and is aimed at young and old.  “Baron van Reede Street, the heartbeat of the festival, will be closed again in 2023. This festive street offers festival-goers free entertainment with impromptu performances, music and delicious food and drinks, from early morning until late at night,” he said. Ticket sales for Friends of the KKNK open on January 30 and on February 1 for the public. Tickets will be sold online at Webtickets, or at your nearest Pick n Pay.  Weekend Argus
