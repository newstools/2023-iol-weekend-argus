Cape Town - The Western Cape Education Department (WCED) says it has made gains in pupil placement for the 2023 academic year, but late applications remain a reality.  “As of December 20, 2022, 99% of our Grade 1 and 8 learners had been placed at schools for the start of the school year, with 680 learners still requiring placement. This was a massive achievement for our department considering that in previous years, we had thousands of Grade 1 and 8 learners needing placement at the same time of the year,” WCED spokesperson Bronagh Hammond said. “Late applications make planning and placement difficult for a variety of reasons. A learner could have a specific language preference that is not accommodated at their closest school. Each school determines their Language of Teaching (LOLT), however, a particular school’s LOLT may not accommodate the needs of a particular learner, even if they live across the road of the school.” Meanwhile, some parents were still searching for a school for their children.  Concerned parent Donna Daames, from Blue Downs, said she started applying for her two children in 2022. “My daughter is supposed to be in Grade 10 this year, and the little one to start Grade R. I started applying when the applications opened around 15 March 2022, and started appealing in June 2022. I went to school this morning, I got a space at Forest Heights Primary for Grade R because they built new classrooms, it's not ready though, but at least she is placed. “When I went to Tuscany Glen they told me there is no space because too many Grade 10s failed. At Apex I only made it to the security guard, they told me it’s full for all grades. I saw the principal of Malibu High School, she told me I should come back after ten days. I am going to Forest Heights High School to see the principal,” said Daames. Cape Times
