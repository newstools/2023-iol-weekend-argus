Cape Town - Following an outcry by residents, the City of Cape Town said plans to revamp Macassar Beach were ready, pending the availability of funds.  This is according to Mayco Member for Community Services and Health Patricia Van Der Ross after residents noted the deteriorating state of the infrastructure, safety issues and the impact of the ongoing sand mining on the dunes.  Resident Gerome Vermeulen said the entire infrastructure was an eyesore and a hub for crime. The department has plans in place to make improvements to the Macassar Beach recreation area, including construction of braai facilities, upgrading the parking area, establishing a group camping section at the resort and building an eco-centre. "This master plan forms part of the long-term vision for the area, subject to availability of budget to execute these plans.“ Van Der Ross said the existing infrastructure was maintained regularly and cleaning took place every day, including the resort area and ablution facilities on the beach.  "In the current financial year, approximately R1 262 930.87 has been spent on repairs and maintenance. In addition, lifeguards are on duty at Macassar Beach and this has resulted in zero fatal drownings during the 2022/2023 peak season,“ Van der Ross said. Vermeulen confirmed the visibility of lifeguards and said lighting, tidiness of the bushy area and damaged pavement remained an urgent matter. He said the success of developments would result in economic growth and beat the scourge of criminality along the beach. He said the area was mostly used by fishermen.
