This was later exacerbated by more than 4 000 kidnappings in the Western Cape, family massacres at the apparent hands of teenage relatives, a mob justice attack on an e-hailing driver and horrific child killings and police murders. On January 2, 2022, the National Assembly Chamber and sections of the Old Assembly Building were destroyed in a fire. A homeless man, Zandile Christmas Mafe, was charged with housebreaking with the intent to commit arson, terrorism, theft and a separate charge of arson. A murder sent shock waves through the small town of Klawer on February 4, 2022, when the dismembered remains of Jerobejin van Wyk, 13, were found in a dam on the property of Daniel Smit. It is alleged the child and a friend had been picking mangoes in Smitâ€™s yard when he spotted them. Smit is awaiting a bed space at Valkenberg psychiatric hospital.
