Cape Town - Alleged Parliament arsonist Zandile Mafe was a no show once again at his fourth pre-trial in the Western Cape high court this morning. The high police presence that gave an impression of Mafe’s presence,  proved to be a plot twist in the courtroom that was presided over by Judge Nape Dolamo when the State announced Mafe’s absenteeism. Mafe’s lawyer, Luvuyo Godla, confirmed to the court that his client was a no show and expressed confusion at this, as he and his client had lengthy discussions of today’s proceedings, and he had agreed to attend. The State told the court that Mafe refused to leave his prison cell and was persuaded by prison wardens to come out but refused. Godla told the court that Mafe was willing to co-operate with the court in their last engagement earlier this week. Judge Dolamo refused to continue with the matter in the absence of Mafe as this would infringe on his constitutional rights. Godla relayed to the court that he did not mind going to his client himself, but his client refused to leave the prison cell. Godla suggested a postponement of two weeks to allow him time to engage his client.The State did not oppose the postponement and suggested February 10 as the next date for the pre-trial.  Outside the court, Godla said he was adamant that his client was innocent and that he did not commit arson. Mafe, who turned 50 last month in police detention, has been in the State’s custody since his arrest in January 2, 2022. He is charged with housebreaking with intent to commit arson, terrorism and theft.
