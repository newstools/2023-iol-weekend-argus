South African radio personality Carol Ofori has attributed her dedication and years of hard work to her winning an internal award. Ofori won a Sovas Voice Arts Award in the outstanding commercial - best African voice-over category. Ofori, who has been in the radio and voice industry for more than 20 years, said she was honoured by the award as it validated her belief in hard work paying off.  The radio personality said she never thought she would win an international award.  “I think it will only be a reality when I open the box and look at the statue once it arrives in South Africa when I can feel, touch and smell it,” she said.  “That’s how deep it is for me.”  The awards are designed to honour the community of professionals who perform, direct, produce, cast, engineer, and publish media productions, where voice acting is a central creative element of the work. Ofori said she took a chance when entering the competition and was amazed to have won. “The industry is growing at a rapid rate, and I am sure there are times you feel like you’re not going anywhere. Yet, here I am 20 years later. Be patient and work hard. Put time and effort into your craft. You will get there.” Previous winners at the Sovas winners include American actress Sigourney Weaver and other Hollywood stars such as Jonah Hill, Cate Blanchett, Kit Harrington and Kristen Wiig.
