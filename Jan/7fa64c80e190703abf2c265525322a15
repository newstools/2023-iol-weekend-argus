IOL reported that Durban Metro Public Order Police and police were called to the scene on Sunday. Residents blocked off the Phoenix highway. Community, Pastor Collin Moodley, said this is an ongoing problem. He said the electricity does not return following the end of load shedding. On Saturday night, residents living in an informal settlement near Bonela took to the streets to protest after officials disconnected illegal electrical wires. Dew Force Security's Yusuf Moola said they were alerted to the protest on Saturday night. He said crowds burnt tyres and debris on the roadway. They also damaged infrastructure and stoned vehicles. There was also a vehicle that crashed in the chaos. Some had pistols and were firing live rounds at police and security personnel.  City spokesperson, Msawakhe Mayisela said they were aware of the protests. "We are on record denouncing these protests because we are of the strong conviction that there is no number of grievances that will justify these violent service delivery protests," he said. Mayisela said like many other cities, the cityâ€™s electricity infrastructure is bearing the brunt of load shedding. "Our system is not designed to be switched on and off frequently. This results in many of our mini-substations tripping, leaving some areas without electricity outside of the load shedding schedule. What is also compounding our problems is the issue of cable theft and illegal connections," he said. The City said the issue of cable theft also leads to malfunctions of mini-substations due to an overload, while some areas are left to wait a little longer for electricity to return after load shedding. "Following this situation, we are receiving an avalanche of phone calls from the public reporting power outages, and we are grateful of the effort that our personnel is always putting to ensure that power is restored expeditiously," Mayisela said.
