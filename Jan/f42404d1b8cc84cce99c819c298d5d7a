As the age-old Benjamin Franklin saying goes, “If you fail to plan, you are planning to fail.” This is the recipe that can be given to our children as the new school year is in motion. Starting the school year can be daunting, especially if you’re in a new grade and you have a new schedule, but do not beat yourself up. Start by creating your own routine and ask your mother and father to assist you. This way, you can make time for everything, even playing. The list for the schedule should include time for chores, and that can even just be tidying up your room after coming home from school; making sure you removed the day’s lunch and leftovers from your school bag; and being organised by taking off your school clothes and hanging them on a hanger. Trust me, your parents will be impressed. Next, make a space available for homework, and if you do not have any homework, try to keep the routine going by sitting down to read rather than picking up your tablet or cellphone or watching television. Reading is good for your brain, even if you just do it for 10 minutes. If you have a project, try to get a head start before time catches up with you. For example, start collecting the items you need a few days before instead of telling your parents what you need at the last minute. Make space in your schedule for a time out such as playing, watching television or spending time with your pets. Mental health is also important (I know these words sound big) and that means it’s important to talk about your feelings with your mom or caregiver. Talk about whether you feel nervous about school, having to make new friends or anything that you are afraid of. This is very important, ask your parents to teach you how to tell the time on a  clock or watch. This way, you can learn how to manage your own time, and it is something that will always help you as you grow older. Weekend Argus
