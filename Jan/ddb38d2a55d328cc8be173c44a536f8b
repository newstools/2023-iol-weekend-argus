A SPLIT-second decision during a family visit to the beach turned “Legacy” actor Sean-Marco Vorster into a real-life hero after he helped rescue two women from nearly drowning in the Garden Route.  The dramatic scenes were captured on film by Voster’s co-star and fiancé, Jessica "Jay" Carly Anstey who later posted the video on Instagram. The incident occurred on January 8 when the couple visited Cola beach in Sedgefield, Garden Route, with their 1-year-old child. Anstey posted the video with the caption, "Can’t believe this just happened. Was going to post as a story but this deserves a main post. @seanmarcov my hero." A post shared by Jay (@jayanstey) In the video, Vorster can be seen entering the water to help two terrified women. Other beachgoers also stepped in to lend a helping hand.  Vorster told  “Weekend Argus”  he was not sure what went through his mind when he ran in to try to help.  "It was impulsive and I just wanted to save them. My only thought was that if they were to be drawn in any deeper, we would not be able to help them.” Voster explained that while pulling out the first woman went quite well, the second rescue took more effort.  "There was a moment where I thought I would have to let her go because she kept pushing me under water because she was panicking. I finally managed to calm her down and help her.  "Fortunately, everything worked out and I am grateful that myself and the two women escaped unscathed.“ Vorster added that he was looking forward to 2023 even if it started on a shaky note. “I am currently busy with various series as well as working behind the scenes. It is going to be a good year.” Social media users hailed the actor a hero. Judischonfeld wrote: "What a hero. Without hesitation racing to the rescue.
