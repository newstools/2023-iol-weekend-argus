After a successful return to Cape Town’s streets, the Kaapse Klopse troupes are gearing up for a busy month of competitions to mark the end of a successful season. The much-anticipated Hollywoodbets Cape Town Street Parade hit the streets on Monday and Tweede Nuwe Jaar was celebrated with 20 000 minstrels who dazzled thousands of people who lined up in the CBD to enjoy the festivities.  The excitement will continue this weekend when 15 Kaapse Klopse Karnival Association (KKKA) troupes participate in the Kaapse Klopse competition taking place at Athlone Stadium from January 6. The competition kicks off on Saturday and will stretch into the first week of February. According to organisers the competition will be split into two sections – one section consists of seven troupes, and the remaining eight troupes duelling on different dates.  The troupes will be competing in categories including the grand march pass, klopse jol, best dressed troupe, and senior and junior drum major. The association’s Muneeb Gambeno said attendees can expect a well-organised and safe event. “The competition events represent the ‘sports’ facet of the tradition – firstly it serves to preserve our choral, dance and movement (as well as) marching tradition,” said Gambeno.  “It further serves to spark aspiration in our youth – a platform they can use to become professional artists one day but always understanding that the competition should be healthy. Ultimately, the event brings our communities into the same space at the same time and is a wonderful vehicle for social cohesion.” Tickets are available at Computicket or Shoprite, Checkers and U-Save outlets and start at R30 each.
