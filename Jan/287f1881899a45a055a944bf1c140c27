Cape Town - Kids, with load shedding happening almost every day, do you ever wonder why it happens?  Some Jellybeans shared what they think load shedding is and why they think it happens.  Nkazimulo Ntshweza, who is 8 years old from Cape Town, said load shedding is not nice because one does not have anything to do. “Load Shedding is when the power goes off. There is nothing in the house to use; the stove, the lights, washing machine and TV. It doesn’t feel nice. What if you have something important to do?” Sima Sawula, 7, believes that load shedding makes the metre box blank, making it unresponsive. “Load shedding for me is very dark. When you press a number on the electricity box, the lights will never come on.” Amber Smith, 5, said that she does not like or enjoy it when there is load shedding. “Load shedding is very bad. Everything goes dark. I don’t like it.” Makenzi Magaar, 3, said she also has nothing to do when there is load shedding. “Load shedding, you don’t have power, and you have nothing to do,” said Makenzi Magaar, 3 years old. It is very clear that you all know what load shedding is. It is also clear that you do not like it. This is understandable. Nobody likes it when it is dark, and nobody enjoys having nothing to do, but always remember to always keep a positive mindset and use your time wisely while you wait for the power to come back on. With school opening in a few weeks, use the time of load shedding to rest, as you will need all your energy to focus on school and playing with your friends when schools reopen. Also, remember that you are not alone. Kids from all over South Africa are feeling as you are feeling and are going through the same emotions, too. Cheer up!
