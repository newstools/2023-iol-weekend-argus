Business travel is back, however, the challenges remain; affordability, logistics, efficiency, and reliability to name a few. Therefore, having an expert at the click of a button can save you time and money.  Research highlights the fact that people travelling for business find it stressful, causing them to feel anxious.  Hence, it is advised to put your trust in travel managing companies, as they offer an end-to-end travel service.  Bonnie Smith, GM of Corporate Traveller South Africa said: “Travel bookings are deceptively simple. The process is simple enough and anyone with an internet connection can do it.’’ ‘’But what many people don’t account for is the time it’s taking away from the core business, the unnecessary stress it’s creating, and the exclusive rates and deals only available to TMCs. Often the best deal they can see is still far higher than what a TMC has access to,” Smith adds. Just how do TMCs help you save money?  Business travel is an essential component of business growth and development, as well as employee attraction and retention. Making the shift from unmanaged travel to working with a TMC can be a seamless process that will deliver almost instant benefit, as experts advise.
