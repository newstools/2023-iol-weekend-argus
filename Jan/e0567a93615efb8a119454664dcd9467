Firefighters in the Western Cape spent the festive season dousing more than 20 blazes around the province.  This is according to the Department of Forestry, Fisheries and Environment’s Working on Fire (WoF) programme.  The programme’s spokesperson, Limakatso Khalianyane, said within the first three days of the year, they had already been called out to deal with four fires, of which three were on New Year’s day and another in Ocean View on Tuesday. There, WoF dispatched two Huey choppers, and a spotter plane aviation support vehicle. On New Year’s day, a fire broke out at Kloofnek Drive in Cape Town, and a spotter plane and a Huey helicopter were dispatched to help Table Mountain National Park contain the flames. Khalianyane added that they were asked to assist the City of Cape Town with the Steenbras Dam fire. “Firefighting efforts carried out by our ground crews with the assistance of aerial resources were successful in limiting the burned vegetation to a total of just over 200 hectares,” she said. She said in total, aerial resources flew for 79 hours in December and nine hours in January so far. Khalianyane said the busiest teams during December were Kluitjieskraal forestry support, and Bredasdorp and Uniondale units. Humanitarian aid organisation Gift of the Givers has been on the ground providing support to four Cape Town communities affected by the devastating fires. This includes a Philippi fire on New Year’s Day, where a blaze left one woman dead and more than 760 people displaced after 240 shacks burnt down.  Weekend Argus
