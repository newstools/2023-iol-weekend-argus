Cape Town - A 30-year-old woman will appear at the George Magistrate’s Court after being arrested in connection with an assault of a toddler on Tuesday. According to the Garden Route police spokesperson, Sergeant Christopher Spies, investigations revealed that the mother of the two-year-old boy left him in the care of relatives at Rosedale near Pacaltsdorp in George. “On her return, she noticed injuries to his face and took him for medical treatment at the local hospital. Medical personnel later summoned police and who then found the victim with injuries to his face and an open wound and bruises around the eyes inflicted by an unknown object,” said Spies. He said detectives attached to the George Family Violence, Child Protection and Sexual Offences (FCS) Unit arrested the suspect on Thursday, 29 December, on a charge of child abuse.
