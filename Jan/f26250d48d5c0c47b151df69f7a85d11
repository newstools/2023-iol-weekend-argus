Cape Town – Five men arrested in connection with the murder of a 29-year-old Stellenbosch e-hailing driver are expected to appear in court today.  They were arrested this week after the murder of Vuyisa Mqosomba, a father of five, on January 13.  The Weekend Argus understands Mqosomba’s alleged killers kidnapped and bundled him into his vehicle, a Datsun Go+, and drove him around for “hours” before they dumped his body on Muldersvlei Road.  Mqosomba was allegedly tortured while his hands and legs were restrained in an attempt to obtain his bank card pin to withdraw cash.  His body was found with multiple stab wounds on the same day he disappeared.  Stellenbosch police are probing the incident, said spokesperson Lieutenant Colonel Malcolm Pojie.  “Stellenbosch police has opened a murder docket for further investigation,” Pojie told the Weekend Argus.  “The body had several stab wounds to the upper-body which probably led to his death ... [the body was] found along Muldersvlei Road on Friday, January 13, by passers-by who alerted authorities.” Pojie added: “The victim’s car was found in Cloetesville the next day ... two men were arrested on Tuesday and another three on Wednesday.” The suspects are between the ages of 26 and 42.  Mqosomba’s brother, Thabo, told the Weekend Argus he was “devastated” by his brother’s murder.  “I don’t know what to say ... he went to work on Friday morning, and he didn't come back home. I tried to call him but his phone was off,” he said. “I went to the police station and we found that his car was at Cloetesville. I (had) to identify his body. They roughed him up so bad.”  Weekend Argus
