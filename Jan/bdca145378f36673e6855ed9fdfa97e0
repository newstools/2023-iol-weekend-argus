A Western Cape Eskom employee has been charged with theft after he allegedly stole R500 000 worth of diesel from the power utility.  Angelo Cysman, 40, worked as a plant operator at Eskom in Atlantis. He was arrested a week ago at his home and appeared briefly in the Atlantis Magistrate’s Court on December 28. Cysman had been under suspension at the time of his arrest. He was allegedly caught out during an internal investigation. The investigation revealed that while working as a plant operator, he was granted permission to collect the diesel and allegedly claimed the tanker was empty during the offloading process. The Hawks were later roped into the investigation. Zinzi Hani of the Hawks explained: “Through internal investigations, it was established that the plant operator  permitted a vehicle to collect the stolen diesel from the site and he declared the diesel tanker empty and that all diesel had been offloaded, whereas it was not. “Internal investigation was conducted by Eskom and was then referred to the Hawks’ Crimes Against the State team based in Bellville for further probing, which led to the arrest of the plant operator a month after Eskom laid a complaint for the theft of diesel.” Hani added the matter was postponed to February 24 for further investigation and Cysman was released on R50 000 bail.
