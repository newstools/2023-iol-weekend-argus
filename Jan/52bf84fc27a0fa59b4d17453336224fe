Cape Town - Southern Cape police have arrested a 19-year-old man on Monday, following an accusation of rape of a 75-year-old woman in Riversdale on Monday. According to the police investigation, an elderly woman was at her home on Sunday, January 22, when the suspect, who she knew, forced his way into her apartment. "He allegedly assaulted the victim before he forced himself onto her and later violated her before he fled the scene. The victim managed to raise an alarm, and neighbours responded and alerted police," said Garden Route police spokesperson, Sergeant Christopher Spies. Spies said upon arrival, the police found the victim, who was later transported and admitted to the hospital for medical care. "Riversdale police immediately assembled a team, which commenced with a search for the suspect. His freedom was short-lived when the members tracked him down on Monday morning. The 19-year-old was arrested and remains in police custody. He is expected to make his first court appearance in the Riversdale Magistrateâ€™s Court on Wednesday," he said. Spies added that violence against women and children remains a top priority for the Western Cape SAPS, which will, therefore, continuously endeavour to bring perpetrators of sexual offences to book.
