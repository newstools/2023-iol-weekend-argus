Johannesburg – Entrepreneurs have had to contend with some of the most challenging economic conditions in recent history. It would seem there is no respite for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). SMEs have had to contend with the constantly rising price of fuel over the past few months. The knock-on effects of the constant increase cannot be understated and have put pressure on the profit margins of SMEs. The Department of Mineral Resources and Energy (DMRE) has made the announcement that as of Wednesday, February 1, the price of both grades of petrol will increase by 28c per litre, 500ppm diesel will increase by 9c per litre, while 50ppm low-sulphur diesel will decrease by 1c. Load shedding has only served to compound the pressure as businesses lose out on valuable productivity. So far in 2023 South Africa has experienced load shedding every day of the year.  This has had a negative impact on the economy. Large and small businesses have been severely affected by the unreliable power supply. It is estimated power cuts cost the country over R400 million daily in lost productivity. There are various other ways in which load shedding affects small businesses. It is inconsequential what the primary function of the business is or the industry it operates in, load shedding almost certainly has an effect on the day-to-day running of most business. Andiswa Bata, co-head of SME at FNB, said while SMEs have shown resilience by absorbing costs in the short term, it is inevitable that businesses will have to pass some of their costs on to consumers. “Fuel, and load shedding will continue putting significant pressure on the bottom line of SMEs. However, there are steps businesses can take that will make a big difference in how SMEs will emerge from the current tough economic conditions,” Bata said.
