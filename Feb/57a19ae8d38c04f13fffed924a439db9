Cape Town - There are so many exciting ways to kick the boredom blues away. Before cellphones and tablets, there were exciting games your mom and dad used to play. These fun games will not only get you off the couch, they’ll also get your blood flowing while having lots of fun.  Hopscotch: Ask mom, dad or your teacher for a piece of chalk and draw a grid on concrete, or take a stick and make a grid on the sand. Number the squares from one to nine, then pick a rock that is good for tossing. Start by tossing the rock onto square one. Hop over the rock and hop with one foot or both feet (to follow the hopscotch pattern) all the way to the end. Turn around and come back, stopping on square two. Balancing on one foot, pick up the rock in square one and hop over square one to the start. Continue this pattern with square two. And so on. If you toss your rock and miss the correct square, your turn is over. This game can be played with any number of your friends, but remember, only one person can go at a time. Four Square: Once again you can ask mom, dad or your teacher for chalk, draw and number four blocks. One player stands in each of the squares, with the highest ranked player in number one, lowest in number four. Bounce the ball among the players, bouncing once in the other person's square before that person catches it. If you or your friend breaks the rules, you move down to a lower square or be eliminated. Hide and Seek: This is a classic and timeless game that never gets hold. Gather your friends, one of you counts on an agreed number, and the rest go and hide. Once the one counting is done, they go and seek for the rest. The aim is for the ones hiding to go tap the spot the one counting was standing at. Remember, the one counting cannot peek! This is meant to be fun, so make it count! Remember to make sure you ask mom or dad to apply sunscreen so that the sun doesn’t harm your skin.
