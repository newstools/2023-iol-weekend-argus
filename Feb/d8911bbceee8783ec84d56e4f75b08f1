Cape Town - Valentine’s Day is just around the corner. You can show mom and dad how much you appreciate them on the day of love.  Make mom and dad heart shapes using cardboard or paper. You may need the help of an adult to with the scissors so you don’t hurt yourself. Make sure you have someone to assist you. Once the heart shapes are cut, you can paint them or sprinkle glitter to make them beautiful. Make a bookmark with paper. You can do this by drawing a rectangle and cutting the shape with a pair of scissors. You can write a short, simple message for mom and dad, to remind them just how much you love them. Make mom and dad a Valentine’s card. Fold a piece of paper in half and use colouring pencils to draw hearts on the outside. On the inside you can write beautiful messages for your mom and dad. Make mom and dad a heart wreath. Cut out 33 leaf shapes and fold each in half. For each flower, cut out four identical hearts by stacking paper and cutting them all at once. Fold each in half and glue the sides together to make a flower shape. You’ll need about 18. Hot-glue enough leaves and flowers to cover the hoop (again, get adult help if you need it.) Make mom and dad a necklace using string and macaroni. Use about 10-20 macaroni pieces. Thread them on the string. Once all the macaroni is place, tie the string. You can beautify it by painting the macaroni in red and white, or mom and dads favourite colours.
