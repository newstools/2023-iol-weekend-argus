It’s only been a few hours since AKA’s posthumously released fourth album, “Mass Country”, came out and it’s already got fans dubbing it among his best work. The album was co-executive produced by AKA himself and features the likes of Blxckie, Nasty C, KDDO, Yanga Chief, Emtee, Laylizzy and Thato Saul. The music is rich and dynamic throughout, and it merges diverse sounds like hip-hop, maskandi, amapiano and country music. His goal with it was to create an album that resonated with the masses of the country. As everyone digs in to the late rap star’s album, here’s a look at some of the best reactions to the album thus far: “FOR THE MASSES OF THE COUNTRY. #MASSCOUNTRY OUT NOW. 🌽 A MASTERPIECE INDEED. long live supa mega, live long. 🙏🏾❤️,” tweeted Blxckie, who’s featured twice on the album.
