Cape Town - Although television is said to have negative effects on children if they watch it too much, such as causing sleeping and behaviour problems, parents can turn their kids’ TV obsessions to their advantage. According to an article written by Dr Priscilla JS Selvaraj, television has enormous educational value because it may be used as a tool for learning at home and in classrooms.  “With the range of channels on offer, there is no shortage of educational content. Science, geography, history, travel, wildlife, sports, health, nutrition and agriculture — the list would be endless.  “All it needs is a parent or teacher to carefully choose the right type of content that is relevant to the child,” wrote Selvaraj. As pointed out by Jamma Jango, the following are some of the benefits that television has for children:  TV can help kids learn about a variety of subjects. If there’s a subject your child enjoys, more likely than not, there is a TV show, movie, or educational DVD that explores the subject in detail. Through media, kids can explore places, animals, or things that they couldn’t see otherwise. Most kids are not able to visit the rainforest or see a giraffe in the wild, but many have seen these things on TV. TV shows can inspire kids to try new activities and engage in “unplugged” learning. When kids see their favourite characters engaged in fun learning games, they want to play too. Kids also like learning activities more if they involve beloved characters.  TV and movies can motivate kids to read books. Of the new movies that are released each year, you can bet that several of them are based on books. Kids can build analytical skills by discussing media. Asking questions as you co-view with your children will help them learn to think, solve problems and predict, making TV viewing a more active experience.
