Mfuleni residents are reeling from shock after to two couples shot and killed. Police spokesperson Brigadier Novela Potelwa said the crime experts were still at the scene searching for clues where four people were shot and killed on Wednesday evening. The victims two men and two women  lived in separate shacks where they were attacked. Residents awoke to what they described to a  horrific incident on Thursday morning in Covid-19 informal settlement near Driftsand, Mfuleni. Community leader Chris Nogemane said: “Last night around 11pm, I heard what sounded like gunshots but I thought it was just a car backfiring, so I didn’t investigate. “This morning a neighbour asked about the shots and told me she suspected the shots came from a “rasta’s” shack. We went to look and we saw him and his partner with bullet wounds and we called the police.” Potelwa explained reports from the area indicate that a vehicle had entered the Covid-19 informal settlement at about 11pm on Wednesday night. “Shortly thereafter gunshots were heard and the vehicle left the area. On Thursday morning, residents of the informal settlement discovered two bodies of a man and a woman with gunshot wounds in a shack and alerted the police,” she added. “A few metres from the one dwelling, inside another shack two more bodies of a man and a woman were also found with gunshot wounds. “The identities of the victims are yet to be determined with provincial serious violent crime detectives hard at work probing the murders as well as the motive.” Police urge anyone with information on the murders that could assist the police investigations to contact police on 08600 10111 or via the MySAPS App. Weekend Argus
