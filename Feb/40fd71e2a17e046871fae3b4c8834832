Cape Town - After waiting nearly a year for the trial of 10-year-old Ayesha Kelly to be heard at the Cape High Court, the family were disappointed after it was yet again postponed to August, another seven months due to no judge being available. This year marks the fourth anniversary of Ayesha’s horrific death. Sadly, the murder trial has been stalled at the Cape High Court after a previous delay due to Covid-19 lockdown. Ayesha’s mother, Insaaf and grandmother, Fayrooz received the bad news this morning that the trial had been postponed to August 28. Cameron Julius and Chadwin Williams are facing a charge of murder. A heartbroken Fayrooz said that they were devastated. “This was the year she was supposed to get ready for high school, when my other grandchildren have to get dressed in the morning for high school, I cannot start my day fresh, I am shouting out “Ayesha, get done, Ayesha comb your hair, but there is nothing,” she said. The case had been postponed from May 2022 to February 2023. The State is set to prove Julius and  Williams shot and killed Ayesha on the evening of December 8, 2019 as she walked to a tuckshop. Previously, The Department of Justice and Constitutional Development media liaison officer, Stephen Mahlangu, said the pandemic also had an impact on cases when responding to a query from the “Weekend Argus” on the delay of court cases. He indicated that multiple factors were responsible for backlogs from an investigation to the repair of machines following a cyber attack. Weekend Argus
