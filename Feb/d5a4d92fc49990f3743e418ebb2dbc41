Kids are always excited to try out new things, so surprise your children with picnic weekends. Picnics do not have to be fancy. All you need is a basket, fruit, light food, drinks and some snacks. Always pack finger foods for a kids’ picnic. You can even set up an area in your garden that can be a permanent picnic location for the family. Parks and beaches are the most loved spots for hosting outdoor picnics and kids enjoy being outside and having fun. There are also a number of games and activities you can play together as a family after enjoying the food and drinks on your day out. Run around and play tag or hide-and-seek.  Sing songs and the kids will definitely sing along. Play board games on the blanket and change the rules to make it more fun and less about winning. Have a water balloon fight; children love water and seeing other people get wet. Fly a kite. Find an open field to fly your kites together as a family. Neziwe Kondo, a mother of three, said that this year was the first time she ever took her kids out for a picnic. She never thought it was something fun until she decided to do it. “My neighbours love picnics and I thought I should try it with my kids too. This other day I cooked and made all their favourite salads and snacks and we went to the beach. My kids had so much fun and they want us to go again,” said Kondo.
