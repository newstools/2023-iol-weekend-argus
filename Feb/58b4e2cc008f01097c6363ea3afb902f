Three construction workers are recovering in hospital after being shot at a construction site in Delft.  The incident happened on Saturday while the workers were working on a housing site along Symphony Way. According to witnesses, two men shot the workers and ran to a car that was waiting for them. “Clearly they were just sending a message, they didn’t want to kill them. They didn’t rob them of anything, but they just shot and left. It looked like they were sending a signal,” said a resident who asked not to be named. There were arguments between the residents and the construction companies when the project started a few months ago. The residents wanted community members to be the ones employed on the project instead of companies bringing workers from outside. Nozuko Bobe, a resident who lives close by, said she heard the sound of a rushing car, followed by gunshots. “They were driving the car at a high speed and it went into my street, but I think they realised that they were on the wrong street and they quickly drove to the next street. A few minutes after they left the street we heard three gunshots,” she said. She said she now fears for her life and that the area is not safe at all. Police spokesperson Sergeant Wesley Twigg confirmed the incident. “The circumstances surrounding a shooting incident on Saturday afternoon at about 15:45 in Magalies Street, Leiden, Delft, where three adult males were shot and wounded are under investigation,” he said. He further said according to reports the victims they were busy working at a construction site when they came under attack. The victims were shot in their legs and were taken to a medical facility for treatment. The unknown suspects fled the scene and are yet to be arrested. Twigg said Delft police registered attempted murder cases for investigation. Anyone with any information about this shooting incident can contact Crime Stop at 08600 10111. Weekend Argus
