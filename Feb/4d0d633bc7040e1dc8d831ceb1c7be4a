Cape Town – A 69-year-old man facing charges relating to firearms that he allegedly stored at his home, has seen his bid to be discharged dismissed. Moegamat Kamish, along with alleged Laughing Boys gang members Tyrone Davids, Mikyle Abdullah, Shamieg Matheon, Moenzier January, Malieka Meyer and  Mikyle Davids made their appearance at the Pollsmoor Circuit Court today. Kamish’s legal team brought an application to have the charges against their client discharged, but the judge ruled that Kamish was facing charges relating to firearms that could not be ignored so it refused the application. The State alleged Kamish’s home was a meeting place for the gang and where firearms were stored. Kamish may have the option of taking the witness stand. Eric Ntabazalila of the National Prosecuting Authority said: “Accused one is supposed to be cross-examined and the Section 174 application  was dismissed (referring to accused seven).” Davids is presently giving his evidence-in-chief and is expected to undergo cross-examination. According to court papers, the accused are said to have committed crimes for a period up until April 2019. The charges relate to the prevention of organised crime in that they operated as a criminal gang in the vicinity of Hanover Park. The accused  previously pleaded not guilty to the 28 charges relating to murder, attempted murder and the illegal possession of firearms and ammunition. Last year, Kamish had submitted a plea explanation claiming that he was not aware of firearms being stored at his premises and that he only became aware of it when police arrived. Weekend Argus
