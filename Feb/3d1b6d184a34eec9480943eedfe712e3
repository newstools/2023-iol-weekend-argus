The family of a Manenberg boy who was shot in the head during a drive-by shooting say the five-year-old has come out of a coma.  The Grade R learner was struck by a bullet as he was playing with his friends on Saturday during the same incident that claimed the life of 17-year-old Berto Nathan Mitas.  The five-year-old was rushed to the Red Cross War Memorial Hospital where the bullet  was removed. The child’s mother told Weekend Argus on Tuesday they spent the weekend praying for a miracle.  “I spent everyday since the shooting speaking to my son even when he was in a coma. I have been praying that he comes out and on Tuesday morning he was out of it but the doctors are keeping him heavily sedated. “Things are looking well, he is recovering from the wound and I’m optimistic that he will make a full recovery.” The devastated mom said the shooting shocked the entire family and left her fearful for her oldest child’s life. “I fear for my other son who is a few years older than (the one who was shot), I prefer him to be at school because our area is dangerous,” she said. “On weekends he will have to stay indoors, the shooting has left me really scared.” Police spokesperson Sergeant Wesley Twigg said no one had been arrested as yet for the murder and attempted murder.
