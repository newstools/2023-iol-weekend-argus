Last week featured the International Day of Education, and 10 children at the Carel du Toit Centre in Tygerberg were sponsored to receive a quality education, learning to speak and learn in English and Afrikaans. The Carel du Toit Centre is a school for deaf children and helps them to hear and speak. The kids at the school wear hearing aids which help them to hear better.  They enjoyed the International Day of Education because they had several visitors, including Denolia Pillay, a former student and finalist in Miss Deaf SA. Our friends at the Carel du Toit Centre have big dreams for when they grow up. One of the children said she wanted to be just like her mom and build cupboards for people’s houses. Another said she wanted to be a teacher and another said she wanted to be a fashion designer. They also shared their favourite sounds with the “Jelly Bean Journal”. One said he loved the sound of a car, another said they loved talking and another said they loved loud sounds (they love to talk). The centre celebrates its 50th birthday this year and has been able to provide important services to our friends from all backgrounds.
