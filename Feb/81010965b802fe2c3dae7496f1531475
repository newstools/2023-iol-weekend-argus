Cape Town - The Hawks have apprehended a police officer linked to the kidnapping and assault of two Delft men. The constable, attached to the Table Bay Harbour station, was arrested Wednesday afternoon, 10 days after he was alleged to have been among a group of suspects who held the victims hostage before robbing them. Hawks spokesperson Zinzi Hani said that on January 22, two victims were allegedly taken from their home on Empress Tree Street in Thubelitsha, Delft by four men and were held hostage in a house on Crescent Road, Philippi East. “It is also reported that the suspects also made off with the victims’ vehicle, a blue Ford Ranger bakkie which was later recovered at an informal settlement near Faure drive. “The matter was reported to the Hawks for further probing which led to the arrest of the accused and the safe release of the victims who were immediately taken to hospital for treatment after they were badly tortured by the suspects. “Two vehicles suspected to be used in the commission of crime were seized,” Hani said. Luvuyo Lwabi, 33, Nicodimus Pasapanodya, 32, and Andrew Seko, 25, were arrested on January 24. Hani explained that the trio appeared the day after their arrests and were remanded in custody.  “The fourth suspect who is a police constable, 27, is expected to appear in the Bellville Magistrate’s Court together with his co-accused on February 2,” she added. The officer was arrested during a multidisciplinary operation that consisted of several of the Hawks’ specialised units. “The constable and his co-accused are facing charges of kidnapping, robbery with aggravating circumstances and assault with intent to cause grievous bodily harm,” Hani said.
